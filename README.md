The idea of this repository is to practice internationalization in a code. In this case, only 3 languages will be used: Spanish, Catalan and English.

The code where the internationalization will be used is an example of the typical code of trying to guess a number.

obviously the game code can be made more organized, clearer, more compartmentalized, in conclusion it can be done a thousand times better, but the objective of this repository is internationalization
